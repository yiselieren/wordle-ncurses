wordle puzzle (see http://nytimes.com/games/wordle/
for details).

This is a simple wordle puzzle implementation using
ncurses library and ncurses-Rust binding. Tested on Linux only.

Unlike original game the word length and number of attempts are
flexible and may be configured via command line (use "-h" command
line parameter for details). The default word lenght is 5 and the
default number of attemps is 6 like in the original game.

Thanks for the https://github.com/dwyl/english-words.git
repository for English words database, I just used the words_alpha.txt
file from the repository.
